Write a small app that can monitor the `executionReport` websocket message delay for X ms. 
If your place an order to Binance exchange and the order is matched, there will be a message with event type `executionReport` gives many details.
We want to have a small application that can alert us if the Event time is delivered delayed up to `X` ms.
  - testnet(https://testnet.binance.vision/)) has free funds to trade.
  - `X` is configable, so I can set to 5000ms or 10000ms, etc.
  - Should not use any pre-build library related to Binance or other crypto exchanges
  - Language is not limited, but please give details of how to run.
  - UI is not required, running from terminal is enough.
  - Submit the code into a github repo, we wish to see the commit history
  - Show us your code taste, and let us know how good you are as a software engineer.
